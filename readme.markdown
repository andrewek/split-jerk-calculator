# Split-Jerk Calculator

This is a little HTML + TailwindCSS + Alpine version of [this
calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wSZAaiCSgcMtOqcFZOfzI9uRptdlffzBVqfeyqM_6yQ/edit?ck_subscriber_id=1795845015#gid=0),
which in turn was created by the Stronger By Science folks and mentioned in
[this
article](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/research-spotlight-split-jerk/?ck_subscriber_id=1795845015).

I did it as a quick demonstration of Alpine for semi-trivial form interactions.

All of the formulae came from the linked spreadsheet and do not belong to me at
all. I am not affiliated with Stronger By Science, and if they ask me to take
this down I will.
